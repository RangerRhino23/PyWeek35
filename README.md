# PyWeek35
### Echos in the dark

Made by team **Lenwoloppali**!

Echos in the dark is a 2D semi-puzzle, parkour game based on the theme "In the shadows" it revolves around you the player progressing through increasingly harder puzzles to get to the end of the game and beat the final level known as the "Haraam" otherwise known as "Forbidden" which is the hardest level. 

You have a few abilites which you can use to help you solve puzzles such as, my favourite, Inverse which inverts the world into different state, also known as the "Shadow realm" which can you show you the pesky blocks you cant see in the "Normal" world, during inverse you are slower and can't jump as high but it allows you to see where everything that is invisible is.

I hope you enjoy the game as much as we did making it.


We look forward to us trying out other peoples games and we wish everyone the best of luck in this pyweek 35th compition!
